Code-Summarize-RAG

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that automatically analyzes GitHub repositories, retrieves semantically relevant code files, and generates high-quality AI summaries using OpenAI models, FAISS vector search, and transformer-based embeddings.

This project showcases full-stack AI engineering — combining NLP, vector databases, backend systems, and applied ML — making it suitable for hiring teams and graduate admissions committees evaluating AI/ML competency.
